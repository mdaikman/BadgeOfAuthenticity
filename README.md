# BadgeOfAuthenticity
A prototype for a new kind of convention badge

This is the base CircuitPython code for the prototype.
More information on the project can be found here:
https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/donovanaikman/

To build the prototype yourself you will only need the following things:
•	Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT microcontroller [11]
•	PN-532 RFID reader (Elechouse or Adafruit recommended)
•	Breadboard and wires as needed
To assemble this, connect the RFID reader to the ESP32 using the I2C wiring described here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pn532-rfid-nfc/python-circuitpython
A badge holder is not required, but recommended. The one used here is available at: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7MgtKQ2ldpI?sharecode=5DyV6Mq8XqgFC9GqAHpoEtFASltxVc_wlimsTBUGp6Y.
